# General-Purpose Psychology Agent — Lab Notebook

Structured session log. Each entry records what was done, key decisions, and
artifacts produced. Terse and factual — the journal.md has the narrative.

**Primary source:** Conversation transcripts (not yet archived)
**Derived views:** `journal.md` (narrative), `docs/architecture.md` (design)

## 2026-03-01 — Session 1 (Architecture design, skill creation)

**Scope:** General-purpose psychology agent — initial architecture design session.

**PSQ analysis completed.** Full analysis delivered covering construct validity,
criterion validity across 4 datasets (AUC 0.57–0.73), open vulnerabilities, and
PSQ readiness for sub-agent integration.

**Style conventions calibrated:**
- APA-style formatting with 1.618x whitespace
- Pedagogical jargon policy: expand acronyms on first use, define in prose
- Clean parentheticals: expansion only (3–7 words max inside parens)
- LaTeX for complex docs, markdown for standard docs

**Design decisions resolved** (full table in docs/architecture.md):
- Three-layer architecture: general agent → sub-agents → adversarial evaluator
- PJE reframed as case study, not sub-agent or specification
- Tiered adversarial evaluator (lightweight default, escalate on disagreement)
- Natural language for agent-to-agent protocol
- Extensible plug-in sub-agent architecture, no roster pre-committed
- Socratic disagreement stance
- Opus as canonical model

**Authority hierarchy defined.** User = source of truth. General agent = advisory.
Sub-agents = domain experts subject to scrutiny. Evaluator = quality control.

→ All decisions persisted to `docs/architecture.md`

**/doc skill created** at `.claude/skills/doc/SKILL.md`. Mid-work documentation
persistence — complement to `/cycle`. Tested on session restart; confirmed loading.

**CLAUDE.md created** at project root. Registers `/doc` skill, summarizes key
conventions, points to sub-projects.

**Standard documentation created:**
- `journal.md` — research narrative (backfilled §1–5)
- `lab-notebook.md` — this file
- `TODO.md` — task backlog
- `ideas.md` — speculative ideas
- `README.md` — project overview

**Memory hygiene rules added to MEMORY.md:**
- Don't persist speculation as fact (reason freely, persist only confirmed)
- Organize semantically by topic, not chronologically
- Don't duplicate CLAUDE.md
- No duplicate entries
- Update or remove wrong memories
- 200-line limit
- Test skills after creating them

**Open (deferred to next exchange):**
- Audience adaptation for Socratic protocol
- Machine-to-machine stance question
- Architecture items 1–3 (general agent design, sub-agent protocol, evaluator)

## 2026-03-01 — Session 2 (Cognitive infrastructure, pre-architecture resolution)

**Scope:** Build cognitive infrastructure; resolve all pre-architecture open questions.

**Cognitive infrastructure built:**
- `memory/cognitive-triggers.md` — T1–T11 trigger system (session start through self-audit)
- `lessons.md` — personal learning log, 10 entries backfilled (not git-tracked)
- `lessons.md.example` — tracked format stub
- T10: lessons trigger. T11: cogarch self-audit with future mitigations
- Recommend-against check added to T3; process vs. substance distinction added
- Explicit pacing + cognitive accessibility policy added
- cogarch abbreviation established

**Design decisions resolved:**
- Socratic protocol → dynamic calibration (not fixed audience categories). Machine callers detected structurally; Socratic stance drops for machines.
- Sub-agent implementation → staged hybrid: Stage 1 (separate Claude Code sessions, human-mediated, define comm standard), Stage 2 (programmatic when PSQ API-ready), Stage 3 (MCP, not pre-committed)
- → Both persisted to `docs/architecture.md` and `MEMORY.md`

**Vocabulary policy:** Incorporate elements of SWEBOK (SE design) and PMBOK (planning/risk) into operational vocabulary. Term collision rule: specify domain on first use. Standards vocabulary adapter concept added to `ideas.md`.

**200-line MEMORY.md limit clarified:** Hard system constraint (lines 201+ silently truncated). CLAUDE.md (~175 lines available) and CLAUDE.local.md (auto-gitignored, discovered this session) are additional always-loaded space.

**T11 self-audit run:** 10 findings, 7 fixed (stale docs, missing Socratic triggers, confidence calibration trigger, T1 cognitive-triggers load, T11 creation). 3 deferred with future mitigations.
