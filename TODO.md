# Psychology Agent — TODO

Forward-looking task list only. Completed and emergent work goes to
`lab-notebook.md`, not here. See `lab-notebook.md` for session history.

---

## Architecture

- [ ] `/turn` route — blocked by API credits. Re-enable checklist:
  1. `wrangler secret put ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
  2. Remove 503 guard in worker.js `/turn` handler
  3. `wrangler d1 execute psychology-interface --file=src/schema.sql`

## Upstream Contribution

- [ ] **PR to CreatmanCEO/claude-code-antiregression-setup** — contribute memory
  persistence, self-healing bootstrap, epistemic triggers, and provenance tracking.
  Six proposed changes: memory snapshot layer, bootstrap-check.sh, planner cognitive
  triggers (recommend-against + process/substance), epistemic flags in code-reviewer
  output, provenance tracking on CLAUDE.md template, content guard hook for CLAUDE.md.
  Full PR spec in lab-notebook Session 11.
  *Precondition: our implementations stable and tested across 2+ sessions*

## Awesome-Claude-Code Integration

- [ ] **Phase-locked sub-agent orchestration** (Rank 4) — sub-agents return data
  only; orchestrator holds exclusive write authority. Prevents rogue sub-agent
  writes. Directly relevant to Architecture Item 2 (sub-agent protocol).
  *Source: Compound Eng phase-locked execution*
  *Precondition: Architecture Item 2 in progress*

- [ ] **Competing hypotheses workflow** (Rank 6) — 3-5 hypotheses with quality criteria
  (testability, falsifiability, parsimony). Reference material for adversarial evaluator.
  *Source: K-Dense hypothesis-generation skill*
  *Precondition: Architecture Item 3 (adversarial evaluator) in progress*

- [ ] **Activity logger** (Rank 7) — SQLite-backed cross-session audit trail as
  complement to markdown lab-notebook. Structured, queryable.
  *Source: Simone MCP activity logger*
  *Precondition: implementation phase (code exists to log against)*

## Awesome-Claude-Code Submission

- [ ] **Submit to awesome-claude-code** — file issue via web form at
  `https://github.com/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code/issues/new?template=recommend-resource.yml`.
  Category: Workflows & Knowledge Guides. Draft submission details in
  lab-notebook Session 12. Note: NC license may face scrutiny under their
  open-source compliance requirement — flag proactively.
  *Precondition: README polished, repo represents current state*

---

## Tooling

- [ ] **Investigate alternative Claude Code client ("psychology interface")** —
  explore building a custom client tailored to the psychology agent use case:
  a purpose-built interface for psychological analysis, research, and consultation
  rather than a generic coding assistant shell. Questions to investigate:
  (1) What does the Claude Code SDK / extension API expose to alternative clients?
  (2) What session, context, and memory management primitives would carry over?
  (3) What does a psychology-specific UI need that the CLI does not provide
      (structured output display, PSQ score visualization, session continuity
      across consultations, IRB-safe data handling)?
  Start with the SDK surface before committing to scope.

## PSQ Scoring Quality

- [x] **Cross-scorer concordance study (Opus vs Sonnet)** — COMPLETE (Session 45,
  turn 19). Gate FAILS: mean ICC(2,1) = 0.495, 1/10 dims pass ICC ≥ 0.70.
  Opus and Sonnet produce non-interchangeable scores. Sonnet-only revert endorsed
  (turn 20). Production models (v23, v35) confirmed clean.

- [ ] **Opus remediation + v37 retrain** — delete 10,000 Opus scores from psq.db,
  re-score 999 texts (368 rescore + 631 HI augmentation) with Sonnet via
  separated-LLM protocol, retrain → v37. Compare held-out r against v35 (0.680).
  *Gate: psq-agent executing. Combined with B3 re-fit (below).*

- [ ] **Dimension structure: partial correlations + bifactor** — Factor analysis v3
  (turn 15) found 1 g-factor (68.2% variance), but criterion validity shows profile
  shape predicts while g-PSQ does not. Step 1 (B4 work order, turn 22): partial
  correlation matrix controlling for g-PSQ on Sonnet-scored data. If meaningful
  residual associations found, Step 2: bifactor model (Reise, 2012).
  *Gate: B4 work order sent. Independent of Opus remediation — can run now.*

- [x] **Recalibrate all dimensions with quantile binning (B3)** — STEPS 1-4 COMPLETE
  (Session 45, turn 20). Quantile-binned isotonic (n_bins=20) improves MAE all
  10 dims (avg −12.4%). Dead zones diagnosed as model range compression, not
  calibration artifacts. Plateau threshold revised from 0.5 max to MAE-improvement-
  without-regression (10/10 pass). Deploy deferred to post-v37.
  Remaining: re-fit v3 calibration on v37, AD per-dimension n_bins tuning,
  deploy + notify downstream.
  *Gate: awaiting Opus remediation + v37 retrain.*

## Dignity Index

- [ ] **Phase A: Feasibility study** — PASS 1 COMPLETE. 50/50 assessed (27 PASS with DI
  composites, 19 ND correct, 4 deferred). Key results: r=0.328 (10.7% DI variance),
  8 signal inversions + 3 partial (spec required ≥5), relevance gate 19/19 (100%).
  3/4 success criteria met. Remaining: Pass 2 (fresh session, inter-rater reliability).
  Study doc: `docs/dignity-phase-a-study.md`. Spec: `docs/dignity-instrument-spec.md`.
  *Precondition: ✓ MET — observatory accepted Phase A (turn 6, PR #63)*

- [ ] **Phase B: Instrument design** — Hicks-based Dignity Index scoring prompt,
  calibration protocol, storage schema. Applies HRCB mode-collapse lessons.
  *Precondition: Phase A success criteria met*

- [ ] **Phase C: Complement integration** — PSQ + DI as independent co-displayed
  measures. Triage routing, DETL computation, mode labels.
  *Precondition: Phase B complete + observatory integration ready*

---

## BFT + Command Protocol

- [ ] **EF-1: Autonomous trust degradation model** — the BFT design treats the human
  as unconditionally trusted (Trusted Third Party). This assumption breaks if the system
  ever operates without human mediation. Define what trust model replaces TTP in
  autonomous operation: (a) evaluator-as-arbiter, (b) cryptographic attestation,
  (c) consensus quorum with 3+ agents, or (d) bounded-trust decay (trust degrades
  over N unverified operations). Document threshold for when autonomous operation
  becomes a real scenario vs. theoretical concern.
  *Precondition: evaluator instantiated (EF-3 ✓) — Tier 1 active, Tier 2/3 pending*
  *Evaluated Session 38: zero autonomous operation pressure observed. No agent has
  attempted action without human approval. Revisit trigger: first Tier 2 evaluator
  session fires. Correctly deferred until then.*

- [x] **EF-2: Claim verification baseline — tracker created** — tracking log at
  `docs/claim-verification-log.json`. Seeded with exchange #1 (rsync to Hetzner,
  7/7 claims verified). Review threshold lowered from 20 to 10 exchanges (current
  rate ~1/week makes 20 impractical). At 10 exchanges with 100% accuracy, relax
  evidence requirements for `verification`-type commands.
  *Created: Session 38 (2026-03-08). Next review: exchange #10.*
